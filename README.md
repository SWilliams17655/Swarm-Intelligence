This program is an early implementation of a swarm intelligent algorithm used for the purpose of algorithm development that identifies shortest path for a swarm of agents moving through a complex environment that varies their speed. Agents working together using this modified swarm algorithm will find the shortest path through the environment while avoiding accidents to resupply multiple sites.
